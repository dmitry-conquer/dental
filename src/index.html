                  <p>
                    The Dental implant procedure involves a titanium post (implant), an abutment, and an artificial tooth (prosthesis), either a dental crown, bridge, or denture.
                    These implant posts are surgically inserted into the jaw bone, acting as the root of the replacement tooth. This unique approach to dentistry offers numerous
                    benefits over traditional full or partial dentures and bridges.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The success rate of dental implant procedures is quite high. According to the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS), dental implants
                    have a success rate of 95% when placed by a dental specialist. The longevity and effectiveness of dental implants largely depend on the patient's oral hygiene,
                    overall health, and lifestyle habits. Regular checkups with the dentist and maintaining good oral hygiene can contribute significantly to the success and
                    longevity of the implant.

                      One of the significant benefits of cosmetic dental implants is that they mimic the look and feel of your original teeth. This authentic appearance helps boost
                      your self-confidence and gives you an attractive, flawless smile.

                    <p class="column__text text-base text-base_white">
                      Missing teeth can eventually cause the face to sag or appear sunken due to bone loss. However, with dental implants, the underlying bone structure is
                      preserved, maintaining facial contours and preventing premature aging.

                    <p class="column__text text-base text-base_white">
                      Dental implants function like real teeth, allowing you to eat, talk, and laugh without discomfort or restriction. They are firmly anchored in place, so you
                      don't need to worry about them slipping or causing embarrassment. It's also easier to maintain oral hygiene with dental implants than other tooth replacement
                      options. This eliminates the risk of decay or infection that can easily occur with traditional bridges or dentures.

                      Unlike other tooth replacement options, dental implants last up to 10 to 25 years or more with proper care. This makes them a long-term investment that can
                      save you money in the long run. Traditional dentures may require frequent replacements or adjustments, adding to significant costs over time.

                    <p class="column__text text-base text-base_white">
                      Unlike traditional bridges, placing dental implants does not involve grinding down the adjacent healthy teeth for support. This helps preserve the integrity
                      of your remaining natural teeth and prevents future dental problems.
