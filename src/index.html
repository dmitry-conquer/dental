                  <p>
                    The Dental implant procedure involves a titanium post (implant), an abutment, and an artificial tooth (prosthesis), either a dental crown, bridge, or denture.
                    These implant posts are surgically inserted into the jaw bone, acting as the root of the replacement tooth. This unique approach to dentistry offers numerous
                    benefits over traditional full or partial dentures and bridges.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The success rate of dental implant procedures is quite high. According to the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS), dental implants
                    have a success rate of 95% when placed by a dental specialist. The longevity and effectiveness of dental implants largely depend on the patient's oral hygiene,
                    overall health, and lifestyle habits. Regular checkups with the dentist and maintaining good oral hygiene can contribute significantly to the success and
                    longevity of the implant.

                      One of the significant benefits of cosmetic dental implants is that they mimic the look and feel of your original teeth. This authentic appearance helps boost
                      your self-confidence and gives you an attractive, flawless smile.

                    <p class="column__text text-base text-base_white">
                      Missing teeth can eventually cause the face to sag or appear sunken due to bone loss. However, with dental implants, the underlying bone structure is
                      preserved, maintaining facial contours and preventing premature aging.

                    <p class="column__text text-base text-base_white">
                      Dental implants function like real teeth, allowing you to eat, talk, and laugh without discomfort or restriction. They are firmly anchored in place, so you
                      don't need to worry about them slipping or causing embarrassment. It's also easier to maintain oral hygiene with dental implants than other tooth replacement
                      options. This eliminates the risk of decay or infection that can easily occur with traditional bridges or dentures.

                    <p class="column__text text-base text-base_white">
                      Unlike other tooth replacement options, dental implants last up to 10 to 25 years or more with proper care. This makes them a long-term investment that can
                      save you money in the long run. Traditional dentures may require frequent replacements or adjustments, adding to significant costs over time.

                    <p class="column__text text-base text-base_white">
                      Unlike traditional bridges, placing dental implants does not involve grinding down the adjacent healthy teeth for support. This helps preserve the integrity
                      of your remaining natural teeth and prevents future dental problems.

                      Your journey towards a healthier smile begins with an initial consultation with our dental implant dentists. During this appointment, they will:<br /><br />
                      Assess your oral health individually.<br />
                      Consider factors such as your medical history, the condition of your gum tissues, and your jaw bone density.<br />
                      Based on these factors, they will determine the type of implant that is most suitable for you.

                      Once it's determined that dental implants are a suitable treatment option for you, the next step is the surgical procedure. <br /><br />

                      The procedure is performed in our state-of-the-art dental practice, equipped with the latest technology. <br />
                      The implant, essentially a small titanium post, is surgically placed into the jawbone where the missing normal tooth was.

                      Once the implant has successfully fused with the bone, the next step is to place an abutment. This small connector post attaches to the implant and serves as
                      a support for the prosthetic tooth. <br /><br />
                      Here's what happens during this stage: <br />
                      The dental implant dentist will make a small incision in your gum tissue to expose the top of the implant. <br />
                      They will then place the abutment on top of the implant. <br />
                      The gum tissue is then stitched back up, leaving the abutment visible above the gum line.

                      The final stage of getting dental implants involves attaching the prosthetic tooth or teeth to the abutment(s). This restoration can take several forms,
                      depending on your unique needs: <br /><br />
                      A Single Crown: If you're missing one tooth, a custom-made porcelain crown will be secured to the abutment. <br />
                      Implant-Supported Bridge: This option is suitable if you have multiple missing teeth. The bridge is secured to two or more adjacent implants. <br />
                      Dentures: In cases where you are missing all of your natural teeth, dentures can be secured to several implants for a more secure and stable fit.
